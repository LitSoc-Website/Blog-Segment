# LitSoc Blog & Content Platform

This repository contains the independent blog and content platform for the **LitSoc Club**. It powers two core functions: hosting official club articles and enabling members to share creative work like poetry, stories, and essays.

Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **TypeScript**, the platform is optimized for smooth content creation, management, and discovery.

> Note: Active development is on the `main` branch.
